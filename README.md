## General Information

"Odin Library" is a simple library management application where users can add, display, and manage a collection of books. The project is designed to practice DOM manipulation, and event handling in JavaScript. Books are stored in an array and can be displayed, removed, or have their read status toggled.

## Features

- **Add New Books:** A form for users to input details about a new book (e.g., author, title, number of pages, read status).
- **Display Books:** Books are displayed dynamically on the page in a cards format.
- **Remove Books:** Each book has a button that allows the user to remove it from the library.
- **Toggle Read Status:** Users can toggle the read status of each book with a dedicated button.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6)
